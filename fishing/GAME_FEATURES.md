# üé£ Fishing Game - Feature Overview

## Core Game Features ‚úÖ

### Interactive Casting Mechanic
- **Timing-based system** inspired by arcade claw machines
- **Visual lever indicator** that moves horizontally across the pond
- **"Ready to Cast"** button starts the lever movement
- **"Cast!"** button drops the line at current lever position
- **Skill-based gameplay** requiring precise timing

### Progressive Difficulty System
- **Multi-level progression** with increasing challenge
- **Fish rarity increases** with higher levels (Common ‚Üí Rare ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Legendary)
- **Reduced pond visibility** at higher levels (opacity overlay)
- **Faster fish movement** and more elusive behavior
- **Level advancement** by catching all fish in current level

### Animated Feedback System
- **Success animations** with point display (+10, +25, +50, +100)
- **Miss feedback** with penalty indication
- **Smooth fish movement** with realistic swimming patterns
- **Fisherman sprite animations** (idle, casting states)
- **Visual effects** for successful/unsuccessful attempts

### Scoring & Penalty System
- **Point multipliers** based on fish rarity and current level
- **Life system** with 3 lives (‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è)
- **Penalty for misses** (lose 1 life per missed cast)
- **High score tracking** with persistent storage
- **Statistics tracking** (total fish caught, games played, best level)

### Persistent Data Management
- **Local storage** for offline play and progress saving
- **Backend API integration** ready for Node.js/Express + MongoDB
- **Player statistics** (high score, best level, total fish caught)
- **Leaderboard system** with top 10 scores
- **Cross-session persistence** maintains progress between plays

## Technical Implementation ‚úÖ

### React Architecture
- **Functional components** with React hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef)
- **Modular structure** with clear separation of concerns:
  - `FishingGame.jsx` - Main game logic and state management
  - `GameCanvas.jsx` - HTML5 Canvas rendering and animations
  - `GameUI.jsx` - User interface and menus
  - `CastingMechanic.jsx` - Interactive casting controls
  - `Leaderboard.jsx` - Score display and rankings

### Performance Optimizations
- **RequestAnimationFrame** for smooth 60fps animations
- **Efficient state management** with minimal re-renders
- **Canvas-based rendering** for optimal 2D graphics performance
- **Resource-efficient animations** with proper cleanup
- **Responsive design** adapting to different screen sizes

### Visual Design
- **Pixelated art style** with `image-rendering: pixelated`
- **16:9 aspect ratio** pond display
- **Atmospheric effects** with gradient overlays
- **Smooth transitions** and hover effects
- **Mobile-responsive** interface with touch-friendly controls

### Game Configuration
- **Centralized config** in `gameConfig.js`
- **Easily extensible** fish types and properties
- **Adjustable difficulty** parameters
- **Customizable game constants** (canvas size, pond dimensions, etc.)

## Backend Integration ‚úÖ

### Node.js Express Server
- **RESTful API** endpoints for game data
- **MongoDB integration** with Mongoose ODM
- **CORS enabled** for cross-origin requests
- **Error handling** with fallback to localStorage
- **Environment configuration** with .env support

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/scores` - Save game scores
- `GET /api/leaderboard` - Retrieve top scores
- `GET /api/players/:id/stats` - Get player statistics
- `GET /api/health` - Server health check

### Data Models
- **Score schema** (playerName, score, level, fishCaught, timestamp)
- **PlayerStats schema** (playerId, totalGames, highScore, bestLevel, etc.)
- **Automatic aggregation** of player statistics

## Game Mechanics Details

### Fish System
- **4 Fish Types**: Common (10pts), Rare (25pts), Epic (50pts), Legendary (100pts)
- **Dynamic spawning** based on current level
- **Realistic movement** with boundary collision detection
- **Size and speed variations** for each fish type
- **Visibility reduction** at higher levels for increased difficulty

### Level Progression
- **Start with 3 fish**, increase by 1 per level (max 8)
- **Unlock rarer fish** as levels progress
- **Increased pond opacity** reduces visibility
- **Faster fish movement** and more erratic patterns
- **Score multipliers** increase with level

### Controls & Accessibility
- **Keyboard accessible** interface
- **Clear visual feedback** for all interactions
- **Responsive button design** with hover states
- **Touch-friendly** controls for mobile devices
- **Screen reader compatible** with proper ARIA labels

## Development & Deployment
